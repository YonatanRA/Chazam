                        Audio fingerprinting and recognition algorithm implemented in Python

                        Chazam can memorize recorded audio by listening to it once and fingerprinting 
                        it. Then by playing a song and recording microphone input or on disk file, 
                        Chazam attempts to match the audio against the fingerprints held in the 
                        database, returning the song or recording being played.
